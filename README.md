## ⚙️ Assembler & Emulator

These programs can be assembled and run using:

- **TASM / MASM** (Turbo or Microsoft Assembler)
- **EMU8086** (Recommended for beginners)
- **DOSBox** (to emulate MS-DOS environment)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the `.asm` file in **EMU8086** or your assembler.
2. Assemble and run the code.
3. Observe the output in the emulator or DOSBox console.
